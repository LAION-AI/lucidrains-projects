## Introduction

This repository gives an overview of the awesome projects created by [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains) that we as LAION want to share with the community
in order to help people train new exciting models and do research with SOTA ML code. 

The whole LAION community started with crawling@home that became LAION-400M and later evolved into LAION-5B and at the same time lucidrains' awesome repository DALLE-pytorch,
a replication of OpenAI's Dall-E mode, that became more and more popular as we trained on CC-3m and CC-12m datasets and later on LAION-400M.

We are very thankful for the great work of lucidrains!
